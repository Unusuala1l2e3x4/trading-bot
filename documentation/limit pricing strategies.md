## Q: 
im using a strategy based on 1-minute bars that focuses on trading when a breakout happens (bar close price increases above a resistance for long or decreases below a support for short), and i intend to use recent quotes data (i.e. past few seconds) to estimate the best limit price at each minute. do you think setting limit prices at the ask for buys and at the bid for sells would be complementary for my strategy? and please describe when setting limit prices slightly above or below can be beneficial.

## A:
Setting your **limit prices at the ask for buys** and **at the bid for sells** can be complementary to your breakout strategy, but with some nuances. This approach would work under specific market conditions, but there are situations where setting limit prices **slightly above or below** the ask/bid could yield better results, especially given the breakout-focused nature of your strategy.

### Why Setting Limit Prices at the Ask (for Buys) and at the Bid (for Sells) Could Work:
1. **Quick Execution in Breakout Situations**:
   - **For Buys**: When a breakout happens above a resistance level, prices can move quickly. Setting your buy limit price at the **ask** allows for faster execution because the market might be moving rapidly, and being at the ask ensures you’re in line to buy shares at the earliest opportunity. This helps you **avoid missing the breakout**.
   - **For Sells**: Similarly, when the price breaks down below a support level, setting your sell limit at the **bid** ensures a quick exit from your position in a fast-moving market.

2. **Complementary to a Breakout Strategy**:
   - Since breakout strategies rely on **momentum**, it’s essential to capture price movement quickly. By placing orders at the ask or bid, you ensure your orders are filled when the price starts moving sharply in the direction of the breakout, which is important when momentum is strong, and the price can rise (or fall) quickly.

3. **Improved Execution Certainty**:
   - By placing a buy order at the ask (or a sell order at the bid), you increase the likelihood of your order being filled because you are essentially joining the **top of the order book**. This helps you capitalize on breakouts without waiting for the price to come to you, which might result in missed opportunities.

### When Setting Limit Prices Slightly Above/Below Can Be Beneficial:
While setting limit orders directly at the ask for buys and the bid for sells can be effective for execution speed, there are situations where adjusting the price **slightly above or below** can provide benefits:

#### 1. **For Buys (Going Long)**: Setting Limit Prices **Above the Ask**:
   - **When to Use**: 
     - If you believe the breakout will be **strong and fast**, and there is a high chance the price will keep moving upward quickly.
     - If you observe **high demand** at the current ask, with large orders or quick replenishment of ask size, indicating that buyers are aggressively entering the market.
   - **Benefit**: 
     - Placing your limit order slightly **above the ask** can improve the chance of execution before the price moves up too far. This can be important if the breakout is strong, and you don’t want to risk your order sitting unfilled as the price moves rapidly away from the ask.
     - It ensures you catch the momentum early without the delay of waiting for the ask to fill completely.
   - **Risk**: 
     - You may **sacrifice a slightly higher price** to ensure execution, but in strong breakout scenarios, this may be worth it.

   **Example**: 
   - If the current ask is $50.02 and you expect the price to spike quickly, you might set a buy limit at **$50.03** to ensure you're filled before the price moves higher.

#### 2. **For Sells (Going Short)**: Setting Limit Prices **Below the Bid**:
   - **When to Use**:
     - If the breakout is expected to be **sharp and downward**, placing a limit sell order slightly **below the bid** ensures execution in fast-moving markets where prices are dropping.
     - If you observe **large sell interest** and the bid is being hit quickly, meaning the bid price may fall further.
   - **Benefit**:
     - This ensures that your short trade is executed before the price drops significantly. In a fast-moving market, getting in early on the downside can prevent missing the optimal entry point for the short.
     - You avoid waiting in the queue at the current bid, which could cause delays and potentially missing part of the move.
   - **Risk**:
     - You might sell at a slightly lower price than the current bid, but this could be advantageous if the price continues to fall sharply.

   **Example**:
   - If the current bid is $50.00 and you anticipate a steep decline, you might place a sell limit at **$49.99** to ensure faster execution.

#### 3. **For Buys (Going Long)**: Setting Limit Prices **Below the Ask**:
   - **When to Use**: 
     - If the breakout above resistance isn’t **strong or clear**, and you expect some volatility or pullbacks before a sustained upward movement.
     - If there’s evidence of **weak buying interest** despite the breakout (e.g., the ask size isn’t decreasing quickly, and buyers aren’t aggressively hitting the ask).
   - **Benefit**: 
     - Placing a limit buy order slightly **below the ask** can help you **get a better price** without chasing the breakout immediately, especially if you expect the price to consolidate or pull back slightly before continuing higher.
     - This works well in scenarios where breakouts are not explosive and the price tends to **oscillate** around the breakout level before a decisive move.
   - **Risk**: 
     - You might miss the trade if the price moves up without retracing, but this is a lower-risk approach when breakouts are not confirmed with strong volume.

   **Example**: 
   - If the ask is $50.02 but you think the breakout might fade briefly, you could set a limit buy at **$50.01** to get a slightly better entry price.

#### 4. **For Sells (Going Short)**: Setting Limit Prices **Above the Bid**:
   - **When to Use**: 
     - If you expect **volatility** around the support level or anticipate a **false breakout** (where the price briefly drops below support but then bounces back).
     - If the **sell pressure isn’t strong**, and you expect the price to retrace before falling decisively.
   - **Benefit**: 
     - Placing a sell order slightly **above the bid** ensures a better price if the price bounces around the support level, especially in choppy markets.
     - You’re reducing the likelihood of selling into a false breakdown.
   - **Risk**: 
     - If the price continues to fall sharply, your sell order might remain unexecuted, and you could miss part of the downward move.

   **Example**: 
   - If the bid is $50.00 and you anticipate some volatility, you could set a sell limit at **$50.01**, hoping for a bounce before the price drops further.

### Summary: When to Set Limit Prices at the Ask/Bid vs Slightly Above/Below

| Scenario                                  | Action             | Suggested Limit Price                     | Benefit                                         | Risk                                      |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Strong Breakout (Long)**                | Buy                | Slightly **above the ask**                | Ensures execution before price rises too far   | Slightly higher price than the ask        |
| **Weak Breakout / Consolidation (Long)**  | Buy                | Slightly **below the ask**                | Better price if price consolidates or retraces | Missed trade if price moves up quickly    |
| **Strong Breakdown (Short)**              | Sell               | Slightly **below the bid**                | Ensures execution before price falls further   | Slightly lower price than the bid         |
| **Weak Breakdown / False Breakout (Short)**| Sell               | Slightly **above the bid**                | Better price if price bounces around support   | Missed trade if price keeps falling       |
| **Standard Breakout (Long)**              | Buy                | At the **ask**                            | Fast execution, capturing breakout momentum    | May miss better price on pullback         |
| **Standard Breakdown (Short)**            | Sell               | At the **bid**                            | Fast execution, capturing breakdown momentum   | May miss better price on retracement      |

### Conclusion:
Setting limit prices at the ask for buys and at the bid for sells complements your breakout strategy by ensuring faster execution. However, setting limit prices slightly above the ask (for buys) or slightly below the bid (for sells) can be useful when you anticipate a sharp breakout or breakdown, as it helps capture the price move more quickly. Conversely, setting prices slightly below the ask or above the bid is beneficial in more volatile or choppy markets where price retracement or consolidation is expected. Balancing speed and price optimization will depend on the specific market conditions at the time of the breakout.



## Q:
i believe i should use a feature engineering approach. this makes it possible to retrieve historic quotes data from the Alpaca API, then construct and save a dataset of features based on the data. this reduces dataset size and speeds up backtesting runs. I already have code set up for quotes data retrieval and processing, so i just need to figure out what features i want when processing each relevant interval of raw data. since my strategy focuses on trading every minute, i only need some seconds before each minute mark (and 1 second after each minute mark to handle any time needed for data processing and calculations)

the raw data is a pandas dataframe. (symbol, timestamp) is the multi-index.
for example, when i print it out it looks like:
```
                                        bid_price  bid_size bid_exchange  ask_price  ask_size ask_exchange conditions tape
symbol timestamp
NVDA   2022-01-12 14:33:00+00:00            283.47       3.0            K     283.57       1.0            T        [R]    C
       2022-01-12 14:33:00.001000+00:00     283.47       2.0            K     283.57       1.0            T        [R]    C
       2022-01-12 14:33:00.004000+00:00     283.43       2.0            T     283.57       1.0            T        [R]    C
       2022-01-12 14:33:00.004000+00:00     283.42       2.0            X     283.57       1.0            T        [R]    C

```
the bid/ask exchange, conditions, and tape columns can be ignored.

i need 2 temporal interpolations to work together. one interpolation for changing sizes, one interpolation for changing prices

changing prices seems more straightforward to use. For example, i can do linear regression on the past few seconds of bid/ask price data, then use coefficient to extrapolate linearly. useful for setting limit prices that increase likelihood of fill in fast-moving markets.

changing sizes is less straightforward. the intuition seems to be:
- strength of buy pressure (demand at the current ask): strong if large orders or quick replenishment of ask size, indicating that buyers are aggressively entering the market.
- strength of sell pressure (demand at the current bid): strong if large orders or quick replenishment of bid size, indicating that sellers are aggressively entering the market.

but how this translates to features is currently unclear to me. here is some starter code:

```
drop_cols = ['bid_exchange', 'ask_exchange', 'conditions', 'tape']

def clean_quotes_data(df: pd.DataFrame, interval_start: pd.Timestamp, interval_end: pd.Timestamp):
    if df.empty:
        return df, (interval_end - interval_start).total_seconds()
    
    df.drop(columns=drop_cols, inplace=True)
    
    # TODO: do any pre-processing, especially aggregations for rows that have the same timestamp.
    # first figure out which ones are worth keeping!

    # example: get standard deviation for all columns per distinct timestamp (then concat columns to df)
    # df.groupby(level=['symbol', 'timestamp']).std()
    
    # other ideas, applicable to all columns:
    # min/max/median
    # first/last (last seems better for real-time)
    # net change
    # number of changes (remove consecutively repeated values then count) - measures overall activity?
    # number of POSITIVE changes in value (count of increases between consecutive rows) - measures buy/sell supply?
    # number of NEGATIVE changes in value (count of decreases between consecutive rows) - measures buy/sell demand?
    # sum of changes in value (cumulative change between consecutive rows) - measures overall activity?
    # sum of positive changes in value (cumulative increase between consecutive rows) - measures buy/sell supply?
    # sum of negative changes in value (cumulative decrease between consecutive rows) - measures buy/sell demand?


    # tip: use the .agg function for calculating multiple values at once.

    # drop duplicate timestamps (if not already removed):
    # df = df[~df.index.duplicated(keep='last')]
            
    # set levels (doable after there are no more duplicate timestamps)
    df.index = df.index.set_levels(
        df.index.get_level_values('timestamp').tz_convert(ny_tz),
        level='timestamp'
    )
    df.sort_index(level='timestamp',inplace=True) # MUST BE SORTED for steps needing the returned dataframe
    
    if df.empty:
        return df, (interval_end - interval_start).total_seconds()
    
    # Calculate the duration until the next quote. useful for calculating time-weighted aggregations. not in this function though.
    df['duration'] = df.index.get_level_values('timestamp').to_series().diff().shift(-1).values
    
    # Set the duration for the last quote to the time until interval_end
    df.loc[df.index[-1], 'duration'] = interval_end - df.index[-1][1]
    carryover = (df.index[0][1] - interval_start).total_seconds() # for adding back to previously processed interval (i am requesting and processing quotes in batches)
    df['duration'] = df['duration'].dt.total_seconds()
    return df, carryover
```

## A:
To make your feature engineering approach effective, especially with temporal interpolations for both price and size, let’s break down what kind of features you can extract from your quotes data to enhance your trading strategy. You already have a good foundation with ideas around standard deviations, first/last values, and counting positive/negative changes, but I’ll expand on how to define features that capture **price momentum** and **buy/sell pressure** based on bid/ask sizes.

### Price Features: Temporal Interpolation with Linear Regression
You’ve mentioned using **linear regression** on bid/ask prices over a recent window, which is a solid approach for estimating trends. Here are features that can be extracted based on **price dynamics**:

1. **Price Slope (Linear Regression Coefficient)**:
   - Calculate the slope (regression coefficient) of **bid price** and **ask price** over the last few seconds. A steep slope indicates rapid price movement, either upward (for buys) or downward (for sells).
   - Feature names: `bid_price_slope`, `ask_price_slope`.

   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   import numpy as np

   def calc_price_slope(df, window=10):
       x = np.arange(window).reshape(-1, 1)
       df['bid_price_slope'] = df['bid_price'].rolling(window=window).apply(lambda y: LinearRegression().fit(x, y).coef_[0])
       df['ask_price_slope'] = df['ask_price'].rolling(window=window).apply(lambda y: LinearRegression().fit(x, y).coef_[0])
       return df
   ```

2. **Price Change**:
   - You can capture how much the bid and ask prices have changed over the last few seconds or the last minute.
   - Feature names: `bid_price_change`, `ask_price_change`.

   ```python
   df['bid_price_change'] = df['bid_price'].diff().fillna(0)
   df['ask_price_change'] = df['ask_price'].diff().fillna(0)
   ```

3. **Price Acceleration**:
   - If you want to detect **momentum shifts**, the second derivative (acceleration) of the price can be useful. This is the rate at which price slope is changing.
   - Feature names: `bid_price_acceleration`, `ask_price_acceleration`.

   ```python
   df['bid_price_acceleration'] = df['bid_price_change'].diff().fillna(0)
   df['ask_price_acceleration'] = df['ask_price_change'].diff().fillna(0)
   ```

### Size Features: Strength of Buy/Sell Pressure
The size data (bid size and ask size) can give you insights into market demand and supply dynamics. Let’s break down the intuition behind the features you suggested:

1. **Net Size Change**:
   - Calculate the net change in **bid size** and **ask size** over the last few seconds. If bid size is increasing quickly, it indicates strong buy-side interest. If ask size is increasing, it indicates strong sell-side pressure.
   - Feature names: `bid_size_change`, `ask_size_change`.

   ```python
   df['bid_size_change'] = df['bid_size'].diff().fillna(0)
   df['ask_size_change'] = df['ask_size'].diff().fillna(0)
   ```

2. **Cumulative Size Change (Strength of Buy/Sell Interest)**:
   - Cumulative positive changes in bid size indicate **increasing buy pressure**, while negative changes in ask size suggest **demand for selling**.
   - Feature names: `cumulative_bid_size_increase`, `cumulative_ask_size_decrease`.

   ```python
   df['cumulative_bid_size_increase'] = df['bid_size_change'].apply(lambda x: x if x > 0 else 0).cumsum()
   df['cumulative_ask_size_decrease'] = df['ask_size_change'].apply(lambda x: x if x < 0 else 0).cumsum()
   ```

3. **Rate of Replenishment (Size Velocity)**:
   - This is a key measure of how fast the **bid/ask sizes are replenished** after they are reduced. A fast replenishment rate suggests stronger buy/sell interest.
   - Feature names: `bid_size_replenishment_rate`, `ask_size_replenishment_rate`.

   ```python
   df['bid_size_replenishment_rate'] = df['bid_size_change'].rolling(window=10).sum()
   df['ask_size_replenishment_rate'] = df['ask_size_change'].rolling(window=10).sum()
   ```

4. **Volatility of Size (Size Activity)**:
   - The standard deviation of bid/ask sizes over time shows how volatile the supply and demand are at each level. High volatility indicates active buying/selling.
   - Feature names: `bid_size_volatility`, `ask_size_volatility`.

   ```python
   df['bid_size_volatility'] = df['bid_size'].rolling(window=10).std()
   df['ask_size_volatility'] = df['ask_size'].rolling(window=10).std()
   ```

### Combined Features (Buy/Sell Pressure with Price Dynamics):
You can combine **price trends** and **size dynamics** to form more sophisticated features:

1. **Price and Size Divergence**:
   - If the price is increasing but the bid size is decreasing, it suggests that buyers are stepping back, and the breakout may not be sustainable.
   - Feature name: `price_size_divergence`.

   ```python
   df['price_size_divergence'] = df['bid_price_change'] - df['bid_size_change']
   ```

2. **Bid-Ask Spread as a Measure of Pressure**:
   - The **spread between the bid and ask prices** can indicate market conditions. A widening spread often indicates uncertainty or less liquidity, while a narrowing spread suggests greater market consensus.
   - Feature name: `bid_ask_spread`.

   ```python
   df['bid_ask_spread'] = df['ask_price'] - df['bid_price']
   ```

### Next Steps: Apply These Features for Backtesting and Trading
Once you’ve constructed these features, you can store them in a smaller dataset for faster backtesting. Here’s how you can integrate these features with your existing data:

1. **Feature Aggregation**:
   - You can use `.agg()` to calculate all the required features within the same function, which should simplify your feature extraction pipeline.

2. **Temporal Interpolation**:
   - To handle **interpolations** for sizes and prices, use resampling or rolling windows to ensure you capture the trends over time. You might find that you need different window sizes for sizes (slower) vs prices (faster).

3. **Saving the Dataset**:
   - Once you’ve calculated all features, save the dataset for backtesting.

   ```python
   df.to_csv('processed_quotes_features.csv')
   ```

By focusing on price slopes, size replenishments, and price/size volatility, you can create a feature set that allows your strategy to **adapt dynamically** to market conditions and improve limit price decisions. This should help improve the efficiency of your backtesting runs.
