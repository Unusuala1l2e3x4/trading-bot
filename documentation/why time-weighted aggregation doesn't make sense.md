## Q:
- using data processed by the **clean_quotes_data** function, i plan to do aggregation within 1-second intervals, i.e. group by having the same second value in the timestamp object. my thinking was that this aggregated data would be helpful for additional analysis and perhaps predicting likelihood of fill.
- since timestamps are no longer repeated, now it is possible to do time-weighted aggregations. however, im doubting if time-weighted aggregations are even useful compared to the intra change values, which we figured out how to do in clean_quotes_data.
- time-weighted aggregation would mean that volatile prices/sizes would be weighted less compared to the stable prices/sizes. my hunch is that this is actually counterproductive, but i'm not sure. what do you think?

## A:

Let's analyze the implications of time-weighted vs unweighted aggregations in the context of quote data and fill likelihood:



You raise a very good point about time-weighted aggregations potentially being counterproductive. Here's why:

1. **Time-Weighted Aggregation Issues**:
- Gives more weight to "stable" periods where prices/sizes don't change
- Could mask important market dynamics - brief but significant price/size changes might indicate strong buying/selling pressure
- In high-frequency trading, quotes that persist longer might actually indicate less market activity or interest

2. **Why Intra-Change Values Are Better**:
- Capture actual market activity regardless of duration
- Each price/size change represents a real market participant action
- More changes (even if brief) often indicate higher liquidity and trading interest
- Help identify periods of active price discovery

3. **For Fill Likelihood Analysis**:
- Quick changes in quotes often signal active trading and higher fill probability
- Stable quotes might indicate low trading interest, making fills less likely
- The number and magnitude of changes matter more than their duration
- Your intra-change metrics (`intra_pos` and `intra_neg`) already capture this information effectively

Example scenarios:
```
Scenario 1: Active Market
Time    Bid    Duration
1.0s    10.00  0.1s
1.1s    10.01  0.1s
1.2s    10.02  0.8s

Scenario 2: Stable Market
Time    Bid    Duration
1.0s    10.00  1.0s
```

Time-weighted average would give similar results for both scenarios, but Scenario 1 likely indicates better fill probability despite shorter durations.

Recommendation:
1. Keep using intra-change aggregations as your primary metrics
2. For 1-second interval aggregations, focus on:
   - Count of quote changes
   - Sum of positive/negative changes
   - Max/min values
   - Spread between first/last values
3. Consider adding metrics like:
   - Change frequency (changes per second)
   - Average change magnitude
   - Ratio of positive to negative changes

These would better represent actual market activity and liquidity than time-weighted metrics.

Would you like me to propose a specific implementation for the 1-second interval aggregation function?
