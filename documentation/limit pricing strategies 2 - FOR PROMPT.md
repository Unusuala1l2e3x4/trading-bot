## Q:

going back to the "When to Set Limit Prices at the Ask/Bid vs Slightly Above/Below" table, please refine the reasoning so that it also considers spread width and size dynamics. correct me if im wrong, but it seems like if the live bid/ask size value bounces around a lot, it can be a sign of high demand, even if the size value doesn't jump a lot at once. also, if price starts moving in a favorable direction but demand (based on size changes) doesn't seem high, or spread width starts increasing too much, it could be a sign of a weak or false breakout.

## A:
You're absolutely right! Factors like **spread width**, **size dynamics**, and **price momentum** all contribute valuable insights for refining when to set limit prices at or near the bid/ask. Here’s a refined breakdown that considers **spread width** and **size dynamics** alongside **price direction** and **volatility** to give a more comprehensive set of guidelines. Additionally, I've adjusted the table to better account for **demand indicators**, **size stability**, and **potential breakout strength**.

### Refined Guidelines

1. **Spread Width**:
   - **Narrow Spread**: When the spread is narrow, there’s typically greater consensus and higher liquidity, favoring a limit price close to the bid/ask since execution probability is high.
   - **Wide Spread**: A widening spread indicates potential volatility or uncertainty. Placing a limit order slightly within the spread can improve execution probability without sacrificing too much on price. If the spread widens too much, it may indicate weak interest in pushing the price in either direction, raising the risk of a false breakout.

2. **Size Dynamics**:
   - **High Demand Indicators**:
     - If **size values bounce frequently** (even if the size changes are small), it indicates active demand and increased competition for those levels. This often strengthens the case for placing limit orders directly at the bid (for sells) or ask (for buys) to capture movement.
     - **Large orders** or **rapid size replenishments** on the ask side for buys or bid side for sells also suggest strong demand, which may justify a more aggressive limit price slightly above the ask for buys or below the bid for sells.
   - **Low Demand Indicators**:
     - If the size values are **static or slow to replenish**, it can be a sign of weak demand, especially if the price is moving in a favorable direction without much support in size dynamics. In these cases, setting a limit order slightly outside the bid/ask can help avoid weak or false breakouts.

### Refined Table with Spread Width and Size Dynamics

| Scenario                                    | Action      | Suggested Limit Price                          | Refined Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strong Breakout (Long)**                  | Buy         | Slightly **above the ask**                     | If the **spread is narrow** and **ask size replenishes quickly** or **bounces frequently**, it indicates high demand. Setting a buy order above the ask ensures fast execution in a rising market. |
| **Weak Breakout / Consolidation (Long)**    | Buy         | Slightly **below the ask**                     | If **size values are slow to change** or **spread widens**, it suggests weak demand. Setting a buy order below the ask reduces the risk of buying into a weak breakout.                         |
| **Strong Breakdown (Short)**                | Sell        | Slightly **below the bid**                     | If **spread is narrow** and **bid size replenishes quickly** or **bounces frequently**, strong sell interest supports a short position. A sell below the bid secures execution as prices fall.    |
| **Weak Breakdown / False Breakout (Short)** | Sell        | Slightly **above the bid**                     | If **bid size remains static** or **spread widens**, it suggests weak sell pressure. Setting a limit sell above the bid can help avoid false breakouts or unnecessary price concessions.         |
| **Standard Breakout (Long)**                | Buy         | At the **ask**                                | When **spread is moderate** and **ask size bounces or replenishes steadily**, it’s safe to buy at the ask to capture upward momentum without excessive risk of missing the breakout.             |
| **Standard Breakdown (Short)**              | Sell        | At the **bid**                                | When **spread is moderate** and **bid size replenishes or bounces steadily**, it’s safe to sell at the bid to capture downward momentum.                                                          |
| **Choppy Market or Potential Reversal**     | Buy/Sell    | Slightly **outside the spread** (depends on spread width) | In a **choppy market with wide, fluctuating spreads** and **erratic size changes**, setting limit orders slightly outside the spread reduces the risk of entering on false signals. |

### Explanation of Each Scenario

- **Strong Breakout (Long)**: Setting a limit buy order slightly **above the ask** is ideal when the **spread is narrow**, and the **ask size fluctuates or replenishes rapidly**, indicating strong buyer competition. By setting the order just above the ask, you’re prioritizing execution speed to catch the upward movement without waiting.

- **Weak Breakout / Consolidation (Long)**: If **ask size is stagnant** and **spread width increases**, it suggests that demand is not strong, raising the risk of a **false breakout**. Setting a buy order **below the ask** is safer, as it helps avoid purchasing into a weak breakout and may capture better prices if the market consolidates.

- **Strong Breakdown (Short)**: A short trade with a **limit sell slightly below the bid** works best in a **narrow spread** scenario where **bid size replenishes rapidly or bounces frequently**, signaling strong seller interest. This helps ensure fast execution in a strongly trending market.

- **Weak Breakdown / False Breakout (Short)**: If **bid size remains static** and **spread widens**, it indicates weak selling interest, which increases the risk of a **false breakdown**. Setting a limit sell order **above the bid** can help capture better prices if the price consolidates or bounces upward.

- **Standard Breakout (Long)**: When the **spread is moderate**, and **ask size bounces steadily** but doesn’t show rapid replenishment or excessive volatility, setting a limit at the **ask** can work well to capture upward momentum. This approach balances execution probability with price optimization.

- **Standard Breakdown (Short)**: In a similar situation, if the **spread is moderate** and **bid size replenishes steadily** without significant fluctuation, setting a limit sell at the **bid** captures downside momentum without overcommitting.

- **Choppy Market or Potential Reversal**: In a market with wide, **fluctuating spreads** and **erratic size changes**, setting orders slightly **outside the spread** (above the ask for sells, below the bid for buys) helps reduce the risk of entering trades on false signals. This approach works well in volatile markets, where false breakouts are more common due to low demand or competing orders.

### Additional Notes

- **High Bid/Ask Size Volatility**: If you observe a high frequency of bid/ask size changes, even if individual changes are small, this is a sign of strong demand on both sides of the book. It’s best to prioritize execution speed by setting orders closer to the bid/ask to avoid missing out on high-demand moves.
  
- **Spreading Out in Wide Spread Scenarios**: In cases where the spread is **unusually wide**, it may be worthwhile to set limit orders slightly within the spread to avoid paying an unnecessary premium. Wide spreads often reflect lower liquidity, increasing the chance that the price could swing back before a breakout/breakdown establishes itself.

Your refined approach, considering spread width, size volatility, and demand dynamics, will allow for more adaptive limit price settings that balance **execution speed, price optimization, and breakout reliability**.
