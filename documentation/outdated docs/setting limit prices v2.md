## My question:
I am using the Alpaca broker for backtesting and eventually real trading, using Python. i have already made lots of progress in my system so im just trying to refine it. currently i only use 1-minute bar data, which is critical for my algorithmic technical analysis, but I do have the retrieval of real-time quotes data set up. I focus on trading the most liquid stocks. I did put in safeguards such as not trading more than 1% of a moving average of market volume based on the 1-minute bars, but this does not react fast enough to fast changes compared to real-time quotes data.

when using real-time level 1 quotes data (level 2 not available), how can i set effective limit prices that have the highest likelihood of fill (within up to 10 or even 50 seconds) while also not straying too far from the market price? consider both longs/shorts, and both buys/sells. keep in mind that the market data from Alpaca does not include "dark" or "undisplayed" liquidity so it does not fully represent the market but can be treated like a sample. 

also keep in mind that it should be backtestable, which does have data constraints. for my strategy, i plan to place trade at beginning of every minute (at the most frequent), with GTC limit orders. that means i probably dont need ALL quotes data, perhaps only needing a few seconds of data before every minute (each second can contain upwards of hundreds of quotes in millisecond precision). this setup would be ideal for my backtesting needs (i retrieve and save historic bars and quotes into zipped csv's, then use the data for backtesting).

the quotes data has these fields:  symbol (key), timestamp (key), bid_price, ask_price, bid_size, ask_size, bid_exchange, ask_exchange, conditions, tape


## Answer from claude sonnet:

1. Data Preparation:

- For each minute where you want to place an order, collect the following data:
  - 5-10 seconds of quotes data before the minute (let's call this window 'x' seconds)
  - 5-10 seconds of quotes data after the minute (for backtesting fill simulation)

2. Limit Price Calculation:

```python
def calculate_limit_price(quotes_data, order_side, buffer_factor=0.0001):
    if order_side == 'buy':
        prices = [quote.ask_price for quote in quotes_data]
        sizes = [quote.ask_size for quote in quotes_data]
    else:  # sell
        prices = [quote.bid_price for quote in quotes_data]
        sizes = [quote.bid_size for quote in quotes_data]
    
    vwap = sum(p * s for p, s in zip(prices, sizes)) / sum(sizes)
    median_price = statistics.median(prices)
    recent_price = prices[-1]
    
    # Determine trend
    trend = 'up' if prices[-1] > prices[0] else 'down' if prices[-1] < prices[0] else 'neutral'
    
    # Calculate limit price
    if order_side == 'buy':
        limit_price = max(vwap, median_price, recent_price)
        if trend == 'up':
            limit_price *= (1 + buffer_factor)
    else:  # sell
        limit_price = min(vwap, median_price, recent_price)
        if trend == 'down':
            limit_price *= (1 - buffer_factor)
    
    return limit_price
```

3. Order Placement:

```python
def place_limit_order(timestamp, symbol, order_side, quantity, quotes_data):
    limit_price = calculate_limit_price(quotes_data, order_side)
    
    # Check if order size exceeds 1% of average volume
    avg_volume = calculate_average_volume(quotes_data)
    if quantity > 0.01 * avg_volume:
        quantity = int(0.01 * avg_volume)
    
    return {
        'timestamp': timestamp,
        'symbol': symbol,
        'side': order_side,
        'quantity': quantity,
        'limit_price': limit_price,
        'status': 'open'
    }
```

4. Fill Simulation:

```python
def simulate_fill(order, post_order_quotes, fill_window_seconds=10):
    fill_time = None
    fill_price = None
    
    for quote in post_order_quotes:
        if (quote.timestamp - order['timestamp']).total_seconds() > fill_window_seconds:
            break
        
        if order['side'] == 'buy' and quote.ask_price <= order['limit_price']:
            fill_time = quote.timestamp
            fill_price = min(order['limit_price'], quote.ask_price)
            break
        elif order['side'] == 'sell' and quote.bid_price >= order['limit_price']:
            fill_time = quote.timestamp
            fill_price = max(order['limit_price'], quote.bid_price)
            break
    
    if fill_time:
        order['status'] = 'filled'
        order['fill_time'] = fill_time
        order['fill_price'] = fill_price
    else:
        order['status'] = 'canceled'  # Assume we cancel unfilled orders after the window
```

5. Backtesting Loop:

```python
def backtest_strategy(data, strategy_parameters):
    orders = []
    for timestamp, minute_data in data.iterrows():
        if should_place_order(minute_data, strategy_parameters):
            pre_order_quotes = get_pre_order_quotes(data, timestamp, window_seconds=10)
            post_order_quotes = get_post_order_quotes(data, timestamp, window_seconds=10)
            
            order = place_limit_order(timestamp, minute_data['symbol'], 
                                      determine_order_side(minute_data, strategy_parameters),
                                      calculate_order_quantity(minute_data, strategy_parameters),
                                      pre_order_quotes)
            
            simulate_fill(order, post_order_quotes)
            orders.append(order)
    
    return analyze_results(orders)
```

6. Additional Considerations:

- Implement functions like `should_place_order()`, `determine_order_side()`, `calculate_order_quantity()` based on your specific strategy logic.
- The `analyze_results()` function should calculate performance metrics, including fill rates, profitability, and adherence to volume constraints.
- Consider implementing a more sophisticated `calculate_average_volume()` function that uses both historical 1-minute bar data and recent quote data for a more accurate volume estimate.

7. Optimization:

- Experiment with different values for the `x` seconds of pre-order quotes data (e.g., 5, 10, 15 seconds) to find the optimal balance between predictive power and data storage requirements.
- Adjust the `buffer_factor` in the `calculate_limit_price()` function to find the right balance between fill rates and favorable pricing.
- Test different `fill_window_seconds` values to simulate various scenarios of how quickly you expect orders to be filled.

This approach combines the use of recent quote data to set intelligent limit prices, respects your volume constraints, and provides a realistic simulation of order fills for backtesting. It's designed to work with your data storage constraints while still capturing the essential dynamics of the market for effective strategy testing.
