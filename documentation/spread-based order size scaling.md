## Q: 
currently i have this measure in place to reduce slippage: limit my trade size (in shares) to at most 1% of the rolling 15-minute average of 1-minute market volume. the rolling average provides a clear normalization factor for my order sizes. however, to have a more complete understanding of the current market liquidity, i also need to factor in spread width, not just volume.

however, im not sure what kind of metric related to spread width that would provide another normalization factor for my order sizes. first thought that came to mind is to proportionally reduce order sizes by the difference between the current spread width and a rolling average spread width, multiplied by some coefficient, if the current spread width is more than the rolling average spread width. but im not sure if this is robust enough.



## A: 
You're absolutely on the right track by considering the incorporation of spread width into your order sizing strategy. While volume provides insight into market activity, the bid-ask spread offers a direct measure of liquidity and trading costs. Combining these two factors can lead to a more comprehensive approach to managing slippage and execution risk.

### **Understanding the Relationship Between Spread Width and Order Size**

- **Spread Width as a Liquidity Indicator**: A wider spread often signifies lower liquidity or higher volatility. In such conditions, executing large orders can lead to increased market impact and slippage.
- **Volume Alone Isn't Sufficient**: High trading volume doesn't always guarantee tight spreads. Market depth and order book dynamics also play crucial roles.
- **Normalization Factor**: Just as you're using rolling average volume to normalize order sizes, spread width can serve as another normalization factor to adjust your orders according to current market conditions.

### **Proposing a Robust Metric Involving Spread Width**

To create a more robust method, you can develop a dynamic scaling factor that adjusts your order size based on the current spread width relative to its historical average. Here's how you can approach it:

#### **1. Calculate the Rolling Average Spread Width**

- **Data Collection**: Continuously record the spread width at regular intervals (e.g., every minute).
- **Rolling Average**: Compute the rolling average of the spread over a significant period (e.g., the past 15 minutes) to capture recent market conditions.

#### **2. Determine the Spread Deviation Ratio**

- **Spread Ratio (SR)**: Calculate the ratio of the current spread to the rolling average spread.
  \[
  SR = \frac{\text{Current Spread Width}}{\text{Rolling Average Spread Width}}
  \]
- **Interpretation**:
  - **SR > 1**: Current spread is wider than average (less favorable conditions).
  - **SR < 1**: Current spread is narrower than average (more favorable conditions).

#### **3. Define a Scaling Function**

- **Objective**: Adjust the order size proportionally based on the spread ratio.
- **Scaling Factor (SF)**: Develop a function that maps SR to a scaling factor for your order size.
  - **Example Function**:
    \[
    SF = \frac{1}{SR^\beta}
    \]
    - **Î² (Beta)**: A coefficient that controls sensitivity. A value between 0 and 1 can provide a balanced adjustment.
  - **Adjusted Order Size**:
    \[
    \text{Adjusted Order Size} = \text{Base Order Size} \times SF
    \]

#### **4. Incorporate the Scaling Factor into Your Existing Strategy**

- **Base Maximum Order Size**: Continue using your current method (1% of the rolling 15-minute average of 1-minute market volume) as the base maximum order size.
- **Adjustment**: Multiply the base order size by the scaling factor (SF) derived from the spread width.

### **Example Calculation**

Let's walk through a hypothetical example:

- **Given**:
  - **Current Spread Width**: \$0.05
  - **Rolling Average Spread Width**: \$0.02
  - **Base Order Size**: 1,000 shares
  - **Beta (Î²)**: 0.5

- **Calculate Spread Ratio (SR)**:
  \[
  SR = \frac{0.05}{0.02} = 2.5
  \]

- **Calculate Scaling Factor (SF)**:
  \[
  SF = \frac{1}{(2.5)^{0.5}} \approx \frac{1}{1.58} \approx 0.63
  \]

- **Adjusted Order Size**:
  \[
  \text{Adjusted Order Size} = 1,000 \times 0.63 = 630 \text{ shares}
  \]

- **Interpretation**: Since the current spread is wider than average, you've reduced your order size to mitigate potential slippage.

### **Ensuring Robustness**

#### **1. Smoothing and Lag Considerations**

- **Avoid Overreacting to Spikes**: Use exponential moving averages (EMAs) instead of simple moving averages to give more weight to recent data while smoothing out volatility.
- **Lag Effects**: Be cautious of the lag introduced by rolling averages. Shorter periods can make the average more responsive but may introduce noise.

#### **2. Setting Boundaries**

- **Minimum Order Size**: Define a floor to prevent the order size from becoming too small to be practical.
- **Maximum Scaling Factor**: Similarly, cap the scaling factor to avoid excessively large orders when spreads are unusually tight.

#### **3. Beta Calibration**

- **Sensitivity Adjustment**: Experiment with different beta values to find the right balance for your strategy.
  - **Higher Beta**: More sensitive adjustments, suitable for highly volatile markets.
  - **Lower Beta**: Smoother adjustments, better for stable markets.

#### **4. Backtesting and Optimization**

- **Historical Data Analysis**: Test your adjusted strategy against historical market conditions to evaluate performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Look at execution costs, slippage, fill rates, and overall profitability.
