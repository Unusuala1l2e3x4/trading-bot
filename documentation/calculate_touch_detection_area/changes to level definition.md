using only the close price to make potential_levels seems way too restrictive. we need the high and low prices (like the original version) to make it more inclusive, otherwise it seems way too unlikely to have touch areas. however, let's re-define what constitutes a level. we want a level to be no longer a line but a thin band with an upper and lower bound (NOT the same as the TOUCH AREA bounds). like your previous version, each datapoint gets its own level. but now lets use a tuple (x, y) as the key in the potential_levels dict, where x is the lower bound and y is the upper bound. then the value of a key (x, y) is a list of touch timestamps (including the initial point's timestamp at index 0). to calculate x and y of each point:

let w = (high-low)/2. x = close - w, y = close + w. but if w == 0, let w = w_prev (the previous point's w). if there is no w_prev > 0 yet, skip until you find a non-zero w.

then as we iterate through the "for i in range(len(day_df))" loop, when a timestamp has a close price within the bounds of a previously-found level, it should be appended to that level's list, AND still also create its own level using the same procedure. 

Once potential_levels is constructed following this method and strong_levels is also contructed (the same way as before), do the same for the "for level, touches in strong_levels.items()" loop, but ill need an adjusted classify_level function like:

def classify_level(level_items, index, df, touch_area_width_agg):
    return 'resistance' if touch_area_width_agg(level_items) > df['central_value'].loc[index] else 'support'

where level_items would be the list corresponding to the (x, y) key, and touch_area_width_agg is already passed into the outer function.




finally, when it comes time to create a TouchArea instance, the level becomes a line - the level parameter would still be the close price of the initial point (corresponds to the timestamp at index 0 in the list of values. retrieve the price from df by indexing with the timestamp).



after we finish this modification, i just need to experiment with a different range of min_touches since the number of touches per level would have increased overall.
