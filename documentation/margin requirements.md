## Initial Margin Requirement vs Margin Multiplier

1. Initial Margin Requirement:
   - This is the minimum amount of equity (as a percentage of the total position value) you must have to open a position.
   - For stocks, it's typically 50% (or 0.5) as per Regulation T.

2. Margin Multiplier (Buying Power):
   - This determines how much you can leverage your account equity.
   - A multiplier of 2x means you can control positions worth twice your equity.
   - The max of 4x is typically for day trading (intraday positions).

Now, to address your specific question: Yes, a margin multiplier greater than 2 can have an effect, even with the 50% initial margin requirement. Here's why:

1. With 2x leverage (margin multiplier of 2):
   - You can control positions worth 200% of your equity.
   - This aligns perfectly with the 50% initial margin requirement.

2. With 4x leverage (margin multiplier of 4):
   - You can control positions worth 400% of your equity.
   - However, each individual position is still subject to the 50% initial margin requirement.

Here's how it works in practice:

Let's say you have \$10,000 in your account:

1. With 2x leverage:
   - You can control up to \$20,000 worth of positions.
   - You could open one \$20,000 position (using \$10,000 of your equity as the 50% initial margin).

2. With 4x leverage:
   - You can control up to \$40,000 worth of positions.
   - However, you can't open one \$40,000 position because of the 50% initial margin requirement.
   - Instead, you could open:
     * Two \$20,000 positions (each using \$10,000 of your buying power)
     * Four \$10,000 positions
     * Any combination not exceeding \$40,000 total, where no single position exceeds \$20,000

So, the higher margin multiplier (3x or 4x) allows you to:
1. Open more positions simultaneously
2. Have more flexibility in position sizing
3. Potentially make more efficient use of your capital

However, it's crucial to remember:
- Higher leverage means higher risk
- The 50% initial margin requirement still applies to each individual position
- Maintenance margin requirements (typically lower than initial) must be maintained to avoid margin calls

In your backtesting strategy, having a margin multiplier > 2 would allow the algorithm to potentially open more positions or larger total positions, but each individual position would still be constrained by the 50% initial margin requirement.
