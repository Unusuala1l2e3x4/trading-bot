# Guidelines for Avoiding Non-Retail Classification on Alpaca

## Introduction
Alpaca offers commission-free trading for retail investors. However, certain trading patterns may lead to an account being flagged as non-retail, resulting in different treatment and potential fees. This document outlines strategies to maintain retail status.

## Key Factors to Consider

### 1. Order Size
- Keep average order size below 10,000 shares per day
- Maintain notional value under $200,000 per trading day

### 2. Order Execution
- Aim for a fill rate higher than 1% of all orders placed
- Avoid excessive cancellation of orders

### 3. Auction Participation
- Limit use of market-on-open and market-on-close orders
- Diversify trading times throughout the day

### 4. Order Splitting
- Avoid unnecessarily breaking large orders into multiple smaller orders
- If splitting is necessary, ensure it's justified by market conditions

### 5. Trading Frequency
- Avoid high-frequency trading patterns
- Limit order placement and cancellation to a reasonable pace (e.g., not more than once per minute)

### 6. Volume Considerations
- Cap trades to a small percentage (e.g., 1%) of rolling market volume
- Monitor daily trading volume across all trades

### 7. API Usage
- Stay within the standard API rate limits unless explicitly increased
- If higher limits are needed, be prepared for potential reclassification

### 8. Professional Status
- Be aware that trading as a primary income source may affect classification
- Avoid using professional trading services on your account

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Your Activity**: Regularly review your trading patterns to ensure they align with retail behavior.

2. **Diversify Strategies**: Avoid relying solely on strategies that may appear non-retail.

3. **Document Your Approach**: Maintain clear records of your trading strategy and rationale.

4. **Communicate with Alpaca**: If in doubt, contact Alpaca support for clarification on your specific situation.

5. **Stay Informed**: Keep up-to-date with Alpaca's policies and any changes to their classification criteria.

By following these guidelines, you can help maintain your retail status on Alpaca. However, remember that Alpaca reserves the right to review accounts on a case-by-case basis.
