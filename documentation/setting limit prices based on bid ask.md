### Aggressiveness of Your Trade:

- **More Aggressive (Immediate Execution)**:
  - **For Buying**: Set your limit price **at or above the current ask price** (outside the spread).
  - **For Selling**: Set your limit price **at or below the current bid price** (outside the spread).
  - This increases the likelihood of fast execution because you're willing to match or exceed the market price, but it might result in less favorable pricing.

- **Less Aggressive (Better Pricing)**:
  - **For Buying**: Set your limit price **within the spread** (between the bid and ask, but closer to the bid).
  - **For Selling**: Set your limit price **within the spread** (between the bid and ask, but closer to the ask).
  - This aims for better pricing but may result in delayed or no execution if the market doesnâ€™t reach your price.

### Summary:

- **Buying** (long entry/short exit): Look at the **ask price** and set your limit **within the spread** (below the ask but above the bid) for better pricing or **at/above the ask** (outside the spread) for faster execution.
- **Selling** (long exit/short entry): Look at the **bid price** and set your limit **within the spread** (above the bid but below the ask) for better pricing or **at/below the bid** (outside the spread) for faster execution.
- Adjust limit prices based on your desired balance between **immediate execution** (more aggressive) and **optimal pricing** (less aggressive).
