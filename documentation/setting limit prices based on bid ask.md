### Aggressiveness of Your Trade:

- **More Aggressive (Immediate Execution)**:
  - **For Buying**: Set your limit price **at or above the current ask price**.
  - **For Selling**: Set your limit price **at or below the current bid price**.
  - This increases the likelihood of fast execution but might result in less favorable pricing.

- **Less Aggressive (Better Pricing)**:
  - **For Buying**: Set your limit price **below the ask price** (closer to the bid).
  - **For Selling**: Set your limit price **above the bid price** (closer to the ask).
  - This aims for a better price but may result in delayed or no execution if the market doesnâ€™t reach your price.

### Summary:

- **Buying** (long entry/short exit): Look at the **ask price** and set your limit **below the ask** for better pricing or **at/above the ask** for faster execution.
- **Selling** (long exit/short entry): Look at the **bid price** and set your limit **above the bid** for better pricing or **at/below the bid** for faster execution.
- Adjust limit prices based on your desired balance between **immediate execution** and **optimal pricing**.
