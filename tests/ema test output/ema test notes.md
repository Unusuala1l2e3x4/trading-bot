#### question

right now, the df returned by StockHistoricalDataClient seems to be 1-minute data but there is sometimes gaps of 2-3 minutes. does that affect the rows that are included within the span?

#### answer

Great question. The gaps in the data can indeed affect how the EMA is calculated, especially when using the default settings of the `ewm()` function. Let's break this down:

1. Data gaps: In 1-minute data with occasional 2-3 minute gaps, some time periods are missing. This is common in financial data, especially during less active trading periods.

2. EMA calculation: By default, pandas' `ewm()` function calculates the EMA based on the index of the data, not the actual timestamps. This means it treats each row as if it were equally spaced in time, which isn't true when there are gaps.

3. Impact on the EMA: These gaps can cause the EMA to be slightly less accurate than if you had perfect 1-minute data. The EMA will put slightly more weight on the data points immediately after a gap than it should if it were accounting for the actual time passed.

To mitigate this issue, you have a few options:

1. Use `times` parameter: Pandas' `ewm()` function has a `times` parameter that allows you to specify the actual timestamps for each data point. This would account for the gaps correctly. Here's how you could modify your code:

   ```python
   df['central_value'] = df['close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False, times=df.index.get_level_values('timestamp')).mean()
   ```

   This tells the function to use the actual timestamps when calculating weights, which should handle the gaps correctly.

2. Resample the data: Before calculating the EMA, you could resample your data to a perfect 1-minute frequency, filling in missing values. This would ensure consistent spacing between data points:

   ```python
   df_resampled = df.resample('1T', level='timestamp').ffill()  # Forward-fill missing values
   df_resampled['central_value'] = df_resampled['close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()
   ```

3. Adjust the span: If you're dealing with data that has frequent gaps, you might want to increase the span to ensure you're capturing enough actual data points in your EMA calculation.

In your specific case, option 1 (using the `times` parameter) is probably the best approach as it maintains your original data while accounting for the time gaps. It's worth noting that small gaps of 2-3 minutes in a 26-minute EMA probably won't have a huge impact on your overall results, but accounting for them can provide a more accurate EMA, especially if these gaps occur frequently or if you're using shorter EMA periods.










#### question
NotImplementedError: times is not supported with adjust=False

#### answer
I apologize for the confusion. You're right, and thank you for bringing this to my attention. The `times` parameter is indeed not compatible with `adjust=False`. Given this limitation, we need to consider alternative approaches. Here are some options:

1. Use `adjust=True` with `times`:
   ```python
   df['central_value'] = df['close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=True, times=df.index.get_level_values('timestamp')).mean()
   ```
   However, this changes the behavior of the EMA calculation and may not be what you want for financial applications.

2. Resample the data (as mentioned before):
   ```python
   df_resampled = df.resample('1T', level='timestamp').asfreq()
   df_resampled['close'] = df_resampled['close'].ffill()
   df_resampled['central_value'] = df_resampled['close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()
   ```
   This ensures regular intervals but may introduce some interpolated data.

3. Use a custom EMA calculation:
   This approach calculates the EMA manually, accounting for time differences:

   ```python
   def custom_ema(series, span, times):
       alpha = 2 / (span + 1)
       ema = series.iloc[0]
       ema_values = [ema]
       for i in range(1, len(series)):
           time_diff = (times[i] - times[i-1]).total_seconds() / 60  # difference in minutes
           weight = 1 - (1 - alpha) ** time_diff
           ema = series.iloc[i] * weight + ema * (1 - weight)
           ema_values.append(ema)
       return pd.Series(ema_values, index=series.index)

   df['central_value'] = custom_ema(df['close'], 26, df.index.get_level_values('timestamp'))
   ```

   This custom function calculates the EMA while taking into account the actual time differences between data points.

4. Use the original method, acknowledging its limitations:
   ```python
   df['central_value'] = df['close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()
   ```
   This doesn't account for the time gaps, but for small, infrequent gaps, the impact might be negligible.

Given the constraints and the nature of your data, I would recommend either option 2 or 3. 

Option 2 (resampling) is simpler and uses pandas built-in functions, but it does introduce some interpolated data. 

Option 3 (custom EMA) is more complex but provides the most accurate representation of an EMA with irregular time intervals. It doesn't introduce any new data points and accurately accounts for the time gaps.

The choice between these depends on your specific needs and the characteristics of your data. If the gaps are infrequent and small, the original method (option 4) might still be sufficient. If accuracy is crucial and you're dealing with frequent or large gaps, the custom EMA calculation (option 3) would be the most precise approach.




#### question
   ```python
    span = 26
    alpha = 2 / (span + 1)
    halflife = np.log(2) / np.log(1 / (1 - alpha))
    halflife_str = f"{halflife}T"

    df['central_value'] = df['close'].ewm(
        halflife=halflife_str,
        times=df.index.get_level_values('timestamp'),
        adjust=True
    ).mean()
   ```


this gives halflife of approximately 9. result are pretty close to when i used

   ```python
df['central_value'] = df['close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=True).mean().
   ```
why is that?

#### answer
You're correct, and your observation is insightful. Let me explain why this is happening:

1. Relationship between span and halflife:
   The relationship between span and halflife in exponential moving averages is not linear. When we calculate the equivalent halflife for a given span, we get:

   ```python
   span = 26
   alpha = 2 / (span + 1)
   halflife = np.log(2) / np.log(1 / (1 - alpha))
   # This gives approximately 8.97, which rounds to 9
   ```

2. EMA calculation with regular intervals:
   When data points are equally spaced (which is what `ewm()` assumes when you don't provide `times`), using `span=26` or its equivalent `halflife≈9` will produce very similar results.

3. Why the results are close:
   - When you use `df['close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=True).mean()`, you're calculating an EMA assuming equal time intervals between all data points.
   - When you use `df['close'].ewm(halflife='9T', times=df.index.get_level_values('timestamp'), adjust=True).mean()`, you're calculating an EMA that accounts for the actual time differences, but with a decay rate that's equivalent to the span=26 in equally spaced data.

4. The role of `adjust=True`:
   In both cases, you're using `adjust=True`. This means the weights are normalized, which helps to make the results more comparable, especially at the beginning of the series.

5. Small time gaps:
   If the gaps in your 1-minute data are relatively small (2-3 minutes), the difference between assuming equal intervals and using actual timestamps won't be very large for most of the data points.

The key takeaway here is that while the `halflife` approach is more accurate in handling the small time gaps in your data, the overall effect on the EMA is relatively small if the gaps are infrequent and short. This is why you're seeing similar results.

However, there are scenarios where the difference could become more noticeable:
- If you have longer or more frequent gaps in your data.
- If you're using a shorter span/halflife, which would make the EMA more sensitive to recent data points and time gaps.
- If you're looking at the EMA values immediately after a significant gap in the data.

For your current use case with a 26-period EMA and small gaps, both approaches (span=26 and halflife≈9 with times) are giving you similar and valid results. The `halflife` with `times` approach is technically more accurate in accounting for the exact timestamps, but for many practical applications, the difference may not be significant enough to impact your trading decisions.
